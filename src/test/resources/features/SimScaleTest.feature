  I want to use this feature file to test create new project workflow on simscale

  Scenario Outline: create new project positive workflow
    Given Launch browser with url "simscale.url"
    And User log in with UserName "user.email" and password "password"
    When user creates new project with inputs "<ProjectTitle>", "<Project_Description>", "<Category>", "<Tag>", "<Measurement_type>"
